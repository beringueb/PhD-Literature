It contains dark matter annihilation/change in fine structure constant and m_e

Compile hyrec as usual

Replace the Makefile_main in the CAMB folder (put Hyrec in ../ w.r.t CAMB)

Copy Hyrec.F90 to the CAMB dir. 
Copy the modified modules.f90 to the CAMB dir. (this makes sure that your code runs on default  when you use pycamb)
Compile CAMB as usual.

You can use the paramsDA.ini file to run with above paramaters. 

Comment about pycamb. To make this work with pycamb you need to compile the 
Hyrec lib with -fPIC to make it a position independent code. 
In addition, I have slightly modified the Makefile_main to make sure the 
camblib is created including the hyreclib. If you do not, it wont recognize 
variables defined in Hyrec (basically, it is usefless). 

I also included recombination.py (thanks to Joel Meyers) to be added to the pycamb/camb directory. It links the parameters
that discribe the above modifications.
