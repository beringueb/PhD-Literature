# PhD
This repository contains some of the literature material used for my PhD at DAMTP.

16/01/2018 : Added HyRec folder wich contains a modified version of HyRec to account for Rayleigh scattering of the CMB off neutral species. Woking version including Hydrogen only. 

17/01/2018 : - Added python scripts used for Rayleigh Scattering. 
             - HyRec is still NOT working correctly, trying to find the correct e volution of x_rayleigh. 

18/01/2018 : - Hyrec is working properly. Outputs the correct neutral species fraction (~0.1% on the spectrum with Recfast)
             - Passed DM_Pann as a parameter in CAMB to constrain it.
